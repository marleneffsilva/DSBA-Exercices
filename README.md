-----A Work in Progress repository-----


# DSBA-Exercices
This repository contains some of my data science/analysis projects completed by me during the Data Science and Business Analytics course. This repository not only have the projects/exercices completed during the course, but also other projects/exercices that I will do for self learning purposes and practice python and SQL as a hobby. The aim is practicing all the contents learned in the course to develop my data analysis skills and obtain experience through self practice.
